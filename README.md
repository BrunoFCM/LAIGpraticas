# LAIGpraticas

In the files "TP1" and "TP2" are the 3 projects developed for this curricular unit. To run them just install the Chrome Extension "WebServer for Chrome" and select each of the files to see every single one of them.

The first work consisted on the making of the parser and scene building (a wizzard in a temple). In the second project we added animations, nurbs and shaders to the previous scene. On the third project we had to build a game interface (by connecting our WEBGL to a prolog console running the game) for, in our case, the game SQUEX.
